A 3-layered architecture, also known as a three-tier architecture, is a client-server architecture that separates an application into three distinct layers: presentation layer, application layer, and data layer. Each layer serves a specific purpose and can be scaled and managed independently, providing high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability.

**Presentation layer**: This layer is responsible for presenting the user interface to the user. It includes components such as web servers and load balancers that receive and process user requests.

**Application layer**: This layer is responsible for processing user requests and generating responses. It includes components such as application servers and databases that provide the logic and data for the application.

**Data layer**: This layer is responsible for storing and retrieving data used by the application. It includes components such as databases that store and manage the application's data.

## Why is a 3-layered architecture important in Cloud?
A 3-layered architecture is important in Cloud because it provides several benefits that are crucial for modern applications:

**High availability**: By separating an application into different layers, each layer can be scaled and managed independently, ensuring that the application is always available and responsive to user requests.

**Fault tolerance:** In case of a failure in one layer, the other layers can continue to operate without disruption, minimizing the impact on the application.

**Scalability**: Each layer can be scaled horizontally or vertically independently, allowing the application to handle increased traffic and workload without affecting other layers.

## Getting Started

### Web Tier

+ 2 public subnets
+ Minimum of 2 EC2 instances with an OS of your choice (free tier) in an Auto Scaling Group.
+ EC2 Web Server Security Group allowing inbound permission from the internet.
+ Boot strap static web page or create a custom AMI that already includes the static web page.
+ Create a public route table and associate the 2 public subnets.

### Application Tier

+ 2 private subnets
+ Minimum of 2 EC2 instances with an OS of your choice (free tier) in an Auto Scaling Group.
+ EC2 Application Server Security Group allowing inbound permission from the Web Server Security Group.
+ Associate with private route table.

`Note: This is not a true application tier as we donâ€™t have any provided code to run on the EC2 instances.`

### Database Tier

+ Use a free Tier MySql RDS Database.
+ The Database Security Group should allow inbound traffic for MySQL from the Application Server Security Group.
+ 2 private subnets.
+ Associate with private route table.

`Note: No need to use Multi-AZ but be sure to document how you would add it`

### Accessing the private instance using SSM Manager

**Prerequesits**

+ Credentials to be set using `aws configure ` or in `~/.aws/credentials` file
+ AWS CLI version >=2 
+ SSM Manager Plugin on the host machine


1. To create an IAM Role for Systems Manager managed instances (console)

2. Attach the IAM role to your instance. You can do this by selecting your instance in the AWS Management Console, choosing "Actions", and then "Instance Settings", followed by "Attach/Replace IAM Role"
3. Open the System Manager in the AWS Management Console. Navigate to `Setup Inventory > Targets > Manually Selecting Instances > IAM role name`.  
4. Select the instance ID of the instance that you want to login into.

```
aws ssm start-session --target *instace_ID*
```
5. You should be successfully logined to the private instance.
6. To connect to the database, get the hostname of the db instance from the console
   + ``` yum install mysql```
   + ``` mysql -h hostname -P 3306 -u username -p ```
7. You should see output something like below :
